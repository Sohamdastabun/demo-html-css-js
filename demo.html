               <h3>Botani</h3>
               <p>The Department was established in the year of 1994 with the initiation of Honours courses in Botany. Around 1953 onwards it was germinated as an Intermediate Streams (I.Sc) without introduction of Biological sciences and passing the days the stream was elevated to B.Sc (Pass course) with Botany, Zoology and Chemistry as combination subjects probably in the year of 1967. System has been changed and now the new pattern has been introduced as 1+1+1 systems in parallel with the Honours courses. The journey was at its very teenage as no full time lecturers at the beginning except a couple of fulltime teachers designated as Instructors. However, the college authority engaged two part-time teachers to run the department in very late stage. The gravity of the department is changing towards better direction. A good number of pass out students already have gone through better opportunity with white colour jobs, NET and RET qualified etc. </p>
